      <span>O</span>man is a small country strategically perched on the southeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula. It shares land borders with the United Arab Emirates to the northwest, Saudi Arabia to the west, and Yemen to the southwest, and shares marine borders with Iran and Pakistan. It has been countinuously inhabited for 106, 000 years. 
    Don't let its small size fool you, in the mid-nineteenth century. <em>Oman was a powerful empire streching from Zanzibar to the coast of Pakistan. Once colonized by the Portuguese,
     the sultante of Oman is currently the oldest independent state in the Arab World. </em>
     
      <img src="images/mapoman.jpg" alt="Map of Oman"/> <span>O</span>man is a country of diverse landscape, mountains, valleys, deserts, coastal plains and sea coasts. In the north, the Al Hajar Mountains reaching 9,800 ft. stretch in an arc southeastward from the rugged coastline of the Musandam Peninsula almost to Raʾs Al-Ḥadd on the extreme northeastern tip of the Arabian Peninsula. Much of the interior is desertic, hot, dry and barren. By contrast, the lush coastal regions are much more hospitable. The capital, Muscat, lies along the northern coast on the Gulf of Oman and serves as a port and commercial centre.
       The south of the country, Dhofar, fertile, is known for its grape and other produce.
        <strong>The climate in general is very hot and dry, with temperatures rising to 104°F or more in mid-summer, with the exception of the southeastern coastal area, cooled by a seasonal monsoon (khareef). Winters are mild, with lows averaging about 63°F.</strong>

      <h2> When to Visit</h2>
        <p>
          In summer (May – September) the temperature rises to 50°C and the humidity to 95 per cent.  From October to April the temperatures and humidity are bearable; the climate feels almost Mediterranean.
          </p>

        <p>
          <strong>The best time to travel through the country is between November and February. The temperatures are between 20 and 30°C, the air is dry and clear, with only rare rainfall. But on the heights of Jabal Shams or Jabal Al-Akhdar, you may encounter snow and very cool temperatures.</strong>
          </p>

        <p>South Oman, on the other hand is a favourite destination for tourists from the neighboring Gulf states from mid-May to September. During these months the monsoon, khareef, brings cooler, moister air.
